The Inequality and Crime website allows the user to:
- Understand how Gini Index means for inequality of an area.
- From the Gini Map viz, give the user a feeling of Gini Index increasing over the years, which means inequality is worse from 2009 to 2017 across the country.
- Give the user an idea that California has more issues on inequality than other states and therefore needs to analyze how inequality related to income and crime.
- Visualize California unemployment rate in order to allow the user to obtain insights and get an idea of state-wide trends to relate it to other metrics i.e. inequality and crime.
- Visualize California incomes and decrease in order to allow the user to obtain insights and get an idea of state-wide trends to relate it to other metrics i.e. inequality and crime.
